# A Taxonomy for Issue and PR Labels

## Overview

Labels are organized into a series of [axes](#axes) indicated by a
prefix on the label. There are no "top-level" labels; every label
belongs to an axis.

For axes with an implied ordering (such as "priority"), colors are
allocated to labels along a gradient. For axes like "type" in which
labels represent distinct, unrelated values, colors can be chosen at
will.

## Axes
